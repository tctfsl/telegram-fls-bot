# telegram-fsl-bot
A Telegram bot to provide first level support guides and steps on routine issues.

# Motivation
Part of my day-to-day job is to provide first level support for a department my team is supporting. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the department is split such that some would be working at an alternate site while some would be working from home. Thus, my team follow suit.

It has been a challenge personally to provide first level support remotely when I'm so used to do it face-to-face. My definition of routine issues means issues that requires common troubleshooting steps and fixes, and requires a lot of time for me to guide them through the whole process.

The bot is to act as a repository for me to retrieve steps and guides, and share it with the users.
