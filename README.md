# telegram-fsl-bot
A Telegram bot to provide first level support guides and steps on a particular subject matter.

# Motivation
Part of my day-to-day job is to provide first level support for a department that my team is supporting. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the department is split such that some would remain in the main office, some would be working at an alternate site, and some will be working from home. This is part of my company's business continuity plan.

With the department splitting into three locations, I've found myself using WhatsApp and calls more to provide support. As a comparison when everyone was working in the office, I'm able to troubleshoot the issue myself and provide the support. When communicating with the user through text messanging and calls, it is difficult for me to gather the information of the issue that they are facing.

Due to the varying degree of computer literacy between end users, some crucial information might have been omitted. This in turn caused more effort is required to troubleshoot the issue. I hope that the Telegram bot is able to guide the user in troubleshooting the issue and gather the right info before they escalate the issue to my team.
